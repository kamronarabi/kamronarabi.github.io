        <p>//Hello, my name is Kamron Arabi. Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
        <p>//I like watching UFC, cooking meals with my roommate, and spending quality time with friends and family.</p>
        <p>//My current passion, however, is programming. I started my coding journey about two years ago learning simple Javascript, progressing to Java, then teaching myself Python before starting at UF.</p>
        <p>//I really enjoy learning new things and being immersed in the field of computer science. Because of this I have joined many CS clubs, such as "Open Source Club" and the "Association for Computing Machinery", to enhance my technical skills and develop myself professionally.</p>

            <h3>Stretch Finder Application</h3>
            
            <p>//An application that allows users to find stretching exercises for specific muscle groups by inputting the muscle they want to target. The app displays the name, preparation, and execution of each exercise, helping users improve their flexibility and mobility. The user friendly UI also accepts case-insensitive inputs for ease of use.
                </p>

        <p>//Here is a demo on how it works! <a href="https://app.screencastify.com/v3/watch/MQq9xm0UrqgfwcwFqZFK">Stretch Finder App Demo</a></p>
